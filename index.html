											"In the interview process, I immediately identified Kim's hustle and interpersonal savvy and recruited her to move from Wisconsin to Atlanta for General Assembly. I was not aware of the incredible poise and resiliency Kim regularly would show over the two years at a fast-paced, ever-changing startup. Kim's personal growth and trajectory truly astounded me. She adeptly pulled herself out of the weeds, always focused on hitting targets and recognized the big picture. Kim shown through as a leader sharing her wisdom and product knowledge with teammates and recent recruits. Kim's vision, organization and ability to drive consistency within the sales department in Atlanta earned her a much-deserved promotion to Operations Team Lead, where she served as the conduit between the Atlanta office and the global organization. It was an honor and privilege to share an (open) office with her during my time at GA."

											"Kim is a great example of an employee who just "gets it." She has an admirable conscience that guides her decision making, and leads her to speak up when something feels off. I was particularly impressed with the pace of her personal growth at GA; when opportunities arose to learn more or take on additional responsibility, Kim was often first to raise her hand and I was confident in the quality of any task I delegated to her. I'm proud of how she's been able to dedicate herself to learning this role inside and out and that she's become a go-to person on the admissions team globally for her deep product knowledge. She's great at rolling with the punches and the rapid pace of change, while paying close attention to details and helping the organization to stay on track. I'd love to work with Kim again in the future."

Her dedication and attention to detail helped ensure timely submissions of Preparedness Updates and revised documents to our local, state and federal partners. Kim assisted with a variety of projects in our office including revisions to public safety documentation as well as the development of Excel spreadsheets to assist in the inventory tracking of state-owned medical assets. I am honored to endorse and recommend Kim to any private or public sector organization looking to hire a very professional, energetic and highly-skilled employee. She is a true "team-player" and I'm confident her talents will benefit any team. They certainly benefited ours."
